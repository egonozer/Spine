INTRODUCTION:
Nucmer_Backbone, along with alignment by the Nucmer function of
MUMmer is part of the Spine algorithm for identification of the
conserved core genome of bacteria and other small genome organisms. 
REQUIREMENTS:
Nucmer_Backbone was written and tested using Perl 5, version 12,
subversion 4. It has been tested on Mac OS X and Linux, but
theoretically should work on any system able to run Perl scripts.
Nucmer_Backbone requires output produced using the nucmer and
show-coords functions of the MUMmer software package
(http://mummer.sourceforge.net). Install MUMmer as directed by the
instructions included with the software.
INSTALLATION:
Simply copy the file nucmer_backbone.pl either to a scripts folder or
an application folder. Anywhere you can remember where it is.
USAGE:
Basic command: perl nucmer_backbone.pl -c alignment.coords.txt
genomes.fasta
For list of options, call the script without any inputs: perl
nucmer_backbone.pl
Required Inputs:

  -c	Alignment coordinates file. Produced by nucmer alignment of
all input genomes vs. all input genomes. To generate this file,
perform the following steps:**1. Concatenate all input sequence files, in fasta format, into a
single file. For example: "cat genome1.fasta genome2.fasta
genome3.fasta > all_genomes.fasta"**2. Produce alignment file using the MUMmer script nucmer with the
"--maxmatch" option to produce a .delta alignment file: "nucmer
--maxmatch -p out all_genomes.fasta all_genomes.fasta". If you are
using a large number of genomes (>10 or so) and you have several
processors to work with, consider downloading and using
nucmer_multi.pl from http://vfsmspineagent.fsm.northwestern.edu to
speed up the alignment step by using multiple processors. **3. Output coordinate file from the nucmer alignment using the MUMer
application show-coords: "show-coords -rTH out.delta >
out.coords.txt"
  fasta sequence file(s)	Can either be the path to the
multi-fasta file produced in step 1 above or paths to all of the
individual sequence files listed seqeuentially. Fasta records with
the same header prefix will be grouped together as one genome (i.e.
in the case of multi-contig draft genomes). In this case, make sure
each header starts with "|genome_name|", i.e ">contig1, >contig2,
>contig3, etc." should become ">|genome1|contig1, >|genome1|contig2,
>|genome1|contig3, etc." The script "rename_headers.pl" is included
with this script to automate this process for you.  Simply run "perl
rename_headers.pl input_file_name.fasta genome_name >
output_file_name.fasta"
Optional Inputs (need to be given before giving the path(s) to the
fasta sequence file(s)):
  -a	Number of genomes from which a section can be absent and
still be considered to be core genome (default 0)
  -r	Genome used as reference for generating backbone fragement
list with "1" being the first genome in the input fasta file(s), "2"
being the second genome in the input file(s), etc. (default 1)
  -g	List of genomes from which core sequence should be created,
separated by commas with no spaces between. Order of the list will
determine the priority in producing core genome. The genome given by
option -r will be given highest priority with all other genomes
moving down by one step. Number of genomes entered must be at least
(a+1) where "a" is the value given to option -a, os if the value
given to -a is 2, at least three genome numbers must be entered. As
with option -r above, "1" is the first genome in the input fasta
file(s), "2" is the second genome in the input file(s), etc.Example: To create a backbone sequence from the second, fourth, and
third genomes given and ignore the first, enter "-g 2,4,3". The
second genome will be given highest priority, the fourth genome
next-highest priority, and third genome next-highest priority.
(default is to prioritize genomes in the order their sequences were
provided, with the first genome having highest priority, second
genome having second-highest priority, etc).
  -l	Path to file listing paths to genbank files of genome
annotations, given in the same order as the input fasta files. File
locations should be one per line. If this file is given, a list of
locus IDs of genes present in the core genome (using IDs from the
reference genome(s)) will be output, as will lists of accessory
genome genes for each of the input sequences. ** WARNING: This option
currently only works if all of the input genomes are complete (i.e.
single scaffold or chromosome) and have a genbank file of
annotations.
  -x	File listing all CDS locus IDs for the input genomes in the
format "genome order number<tab>locus id<tab>start coord<tab>end
coord" (one entry per line). ** WARNING: This option currently only
works if all of the input genomes are complete (i.e. single scaffold
or chromosome) and have a genbank file of annotations. Example:
  1	gen1_0001	456	2176
  1	gen1_0002	3187	4599
  2	gen2_0001	679	3100
  etc.
If an input is given for both -x and -l, only the file given to -x
will be used as input. If an input is given for both -x and -l and
the file given to -x does not exist, it will be created using the
files from -l to create the locus ID file and saved under the name
given to -x.
  -p	Minimum percentage coverage of a locus for it to be output as
core (default 50)
  -m	Maximum distance between core fragments. Distances less than
this parameter will result in outupt of sequence of fragments
concatenated with Nâ€™s representing the non-backbone gaps. (default
10)
  -h	Minimum percent identity for nucmer alignments (default 85)

  -B	Minimum core genome fragment size to output, in bases
(default 10)
  -I	Minimum accessory genome fragment size to output, in bases
(default 10)
  -s	Prefix of output files (default: "output")

  -o	If given, wil output accessory genome coordinates for each
genome (default: only output accessory coordinates and statistics for
reference genome(s))
  -e	Output file of position values that can be used to calculate
pangenome and core genome characteristics of the entered genomes with
core_and_pangenome.pl. If selected, will force -o option. (default:
position values are not output)
  -t	Number of processes to run in parallel. Speeds up analysis on
multi-processor machines. This value should not exceed your number of
processors or you will likely experience massive slowdown. (default:
1)
  -v	Verbose output

genome was found in the sequence "contigA" in the genome "genomeA",
this will appear in Column 1 as "genomeA|contigA".Columns 2 and 3 are the start and stop coordinates of the core genome
sequence, respectively. Coordinates are 1-based.
